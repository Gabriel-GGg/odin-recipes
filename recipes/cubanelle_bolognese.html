    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        I have found myself making daily visits to
        Joseph's Classic Market these days and
        creating new recipes. Not only do we have
        amazing markets here in Palm Beach Gardens
        but our farmers markets are spectacular.
        I got 4 Cubanelle peppers and grilled 2 with
        our steak dinner. Looking at the remaining 2,
        this dish came to me. Enjoy with your favorite
        pasta, spaghetti squash, or sweet potato noodles.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>    2 tablespoons olive oil </li>

         <li>   2 Cubanelle peppers, chopped</li>

          <li>    2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

         <li>    1 pound ground veal</li>

         <li>    Â½ pound ground chuck</li>

         <li>    1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>

         <li>    1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>

         <li>    2 teaspoons sea salt</li>

         <li>    1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium
            heat. Add Cubanelle peppers; cook and stir until
            softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook
            until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
        </li>        
         <li>
            Stir veal and chuck into the saucepan; cook,
            breaking up gently with a wooden spoon, until
            browned, about 10 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes,
            Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Bring sauce
            to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered,
            until flavors combine, about 30 minutes.
